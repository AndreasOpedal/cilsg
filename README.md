# Team cilsg, Collaborative Filtering

Repository for Computational Intelligence Lab course at ETH ZÃ¼rich, spring semester 2020. See submission directory for final model, baseline comparisons and notebook demos, complete with a README explaining the structure of the code and how to run it. 

The goal of the project was to develop a novel approach to the collaborative filtering problem, by combining and extending ideas presented in the course. We built an ensemble model, consisting of classical models involving matrix factorization such as SVD++ and pLSA as well as more modern techniques via a variational autoencoder. The ensemble model compares favorably compared to its contained sub-models.
